## Features:

### Universal Features:
Work when installed on the server or the client!
#### Placement Snapping:
Boats will automatically snap to face North/South/East/West (and 45-degree angles) when placed on ice.

### Client Exclusive Features:
#### Turn Priming:
Pressing the <kbd>⬅</kbd> or <kbd>➞</kbd><sup>[*](#configurable-controls)</sup> keys will prime a turn. When your turn comes up, your boat will stop and automatically rotate 90 degrees!

#### Manual Snapping:
If your boat gets out of its cardinal orientation, pressing <kbd>⬆</kbd><sup>[*](#configurable-controls)</sup> will snap it back to the nearest cardinal (or 45-degree) direction.

#### Instant Reversing:
Need to turn around? Pressing <kbd>⬇</kbd><sup>[*](#configurable-controls)</sup> will instantly rotate your boat 180 degrees!

#### Smart Centering:
Pressing <kbd>&#92;</kbd><sup>[*](#configurable-controls)</sup> will instantly center your boat on the ice. If you're near a wall, you will instead be nudged _off-center_ just enough to avoid crashing into it. This also automatically happens after every turn by default.

#### Configurable Controls:
All keybinds can be configured in the vanilla controls menu!
